End to End Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on predicting the positive or negative sentiment of movie reviews using IMDB data.

Workflow of this Project:

1. Configuration Setup:

    Update the config.yaml file to establish project-wide configurations.

2. Schema Definition:

    Specify the structure and organization of data by updating the schema.yaml file.

3. Parameter Tuning:

    Fine-tune parameters and settings in the params.yaml file to optimize model performance.

4. Entity Identification:

    Define entities such as dataset paths, model parameters, and other essential elements.

5. Configuration Management:

    Implement a robust Configuration Manager within the source (src/config) folder to streamline dynamic settings.

6. Component Integration:

    Integrate components including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training etc.

5. Pipeline Construction:

    Construct a comprehensive pipeline that orchestrates the sequential execution of data processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

6. Main Script Development:

    Create the main.py script to drive the execution of the complete pipeline, coordinating each component's functionality.

7. Application Implementation:

    Develop the app.py file as the final piece, containing the application code to utilize the trained model for predicting sentiment on new input.

This project's systematic workflow encompasses essential stages, from establishing configurations and schema definition to model training, pipeline creation, and application development. It reflects a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis and demonstrates your ability to manage end-to-end data science projects effectively.
